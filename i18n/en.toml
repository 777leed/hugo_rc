After 28 months, he returned to complete his degree and continued to work with his community by establishing a team of engineers to design waste-powered pottery kilns with the local pottery cooperative in Tameslouht. During this time, he established RC and was awarded the Fulbright Student Researcher Award (2018-2019) to return to Morocco to gather sold waste data to support the project. Since then, RC has been working in every part of Morocco forming strong partnerships with local associations and the University of Cincinnati, merging the two fields of sustainable development and education."
