description: "The 2018-2019 Environmental Engineering Capstone Project focused on designing a methane gas capping system for the wastewater treatment anaerobic ponds. The potential use of the methane can be for the new pottery kiln prototypes or for household use. A prototype small-batch reactor is in the process of being designed to verify the cubic meters of methane produced and determine the best gas scrubbing process."
