description: "Resilient Communities has consistently implemented the Zwin-Up activity beginning in the neighborhood of Almajdoub and expanding outward. We purchase 40 pots from The Alibdaa Cooperative of Pottery and Ceramics in Tameslouht and 40 plants from a local nursery. Then, we place two pots to each door and then paint the pots with the neighborhood kids. We have worked with exchange groups to help fund the activity and bring their students to volunteer. The activity has gained recognition throughout Tameslouht, hopefully inspiring other associations to implement in other neighborhoods."
