description: "Resilient Communities has partnered with Fiers et Forts Youth House in Tameslouht to offer collaborative activities for exchange students to engage with the kids living there. The center is well-known in Tameslouht, housing over 40 kids at any given time. They are heavily focused on environmental education, creative and performing arts, and sports. The children are always excited to participate and meet Moroccans from other cities or foreigners from other countries. We had great activities with exchange students from Cape Henry High School with the Morocco Exchange program and NSLI-Y students from the CLC. "
