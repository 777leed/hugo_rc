The initiative involves installing solar panels to power a well and deepening the well to improve water extraction capabilities. This effort addresses the critical issue of water scarcity in the region and supports the local community's ability to manage drought conditions more effectively. The project will provide a sustainable solution to increase water availability for residents and local agriculture, fostering resilience against climate challenges."
