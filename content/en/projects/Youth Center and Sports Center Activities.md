description: "We recently teamed up with the Center for Language and Culture in Marrakech (CLC) to provide social engagement activities for their exchange NSLI-Y students. We organized activities at the Tameslouht Youth Center  and Sports Center with our partner association, Youth for Development Without Borders. We gathering ambitious local students to work with the exchange students to develop their own activity to facilitate during the Zwin-Up activity. On another day, we had fun playing soccer with the same students, opening opportunities for cross-cultural dialogue between high school students."
