description: "As the saying goes, first impressions are everything. In this workshop, participants learn about the importance of first impressions when it comes to networking and expanding projects. An essential part of the first impression is the elevator pitch, or what you tell potential partners and investors to give them a clear and concise explanation of your project as well as inspire them to work with you. Participants get practice in creating many types of elevator pitches, including ones for social media. Participants also practice these pitches and are provided with additional resources at the end."
